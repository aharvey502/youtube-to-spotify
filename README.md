# Instantly transfer a Youtube music Playlist to a Spotify music playlist

## Description
A Python program to automate the transfer of a YouTube music playlist to a Spotify playlist. 

Typically, transferring music from YouTube to Spotify would require a user to find the song in their
YouTube playlist, copy the song title, paste the song title into Spotify, go through the search results, and add the correct song to a Spotify playlist. This process has to be repeated for each individual song in a playlist, which can be quite extensive. This program eliminates this individual manual transfer by allowing users to automatically populate a Spotify playlist with however many songs from a YouTube playlist in one go.
