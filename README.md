# youtube-to-spotify

A Python program to automate the transfer of a YouTube music playlist to a Spotify playlist. 

Typically, transferring music from YouTube to Spotify would require a user to find the song in their
YouTube playlist, copy the song title, paste the song titled into Spotify, go through the search results, and add the correct song to their Spotify playlist. This process has to be repeated for each individual song in a playlist, which can be quite extensive. This program eliminates this individual manual transfer by allowing users to automatically populate a Spotify playlist with  however many songs needed songs in a YouTube playlist in one go.
